Final Project for Drawing on the Web [Spring 2019]


#Outline
-----------------------

The web allows for a whole new way of exploring physical space. Visualizing and experiencing structural forms through a website has the possibility of being an immersive, spatial experience. This semester in my Modern Architecture class, I learned the importance and beauty of ideal architectural sketches. These are sketches that famous architects have created for buildings they often have no intention, or at the time lacked the technological advances, to build. These sketches are often beautiful, capturing both the technical structure and the spirit of the building. These works often offer an axonometric view of the structure, allowing the viewer to picture the building on multiple axes, such as the 1923 model of Theo Van Doesburg’s ["Project for Private Villa”](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/232). I hope to be inspired by several architects,  such as the ideal sketches of Hermann Finsterlin and Wenzel Hablik, the use of color and lines of Luis Barragan, and the 2-d sculptures of Kazimir Malevich. I am still figuring out the exact logistics of my drawings, but I hope to create a homepage that either depicts a city block or a 2-d, interactive sculpture, and three unique drawings with imagined structures that the user can explore and navigate through on multiple planes (likely via javascript and WebGL). I hope to put thought and creative effort into capturing the individual “spirit” of each structure.
